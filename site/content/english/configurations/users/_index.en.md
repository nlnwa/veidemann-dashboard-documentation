From the user page you can administrate users of Veidemann dashboard. A user with admin rights cant create new users or
manage existing users of the system.

A user is identified with one of two types:

- E-mail
- Group

A user must also be assigned one or more roles. The role given to the user will determine which pages the user can access,
and what actions the user is able to perform in Veidemann dashboard.


The available roles in Veidemann are:

- **Any:**  The role given to users that is not logged in.

- **Any user:**   A registered user, but cannot enter configuration pages. 

- **Readonly:**  User with readonly rights. Can access most of the pages, but is not able to create or edit configurations.

- **Curator:** Can access to most of the system, but is lacking the right to create/update some of the configurations.
  
- **Admin:**  Can access to everything.
